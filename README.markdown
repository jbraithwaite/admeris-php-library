Refactored Admeris PHP Core API
===============================

## Background


[Admeris Payment Systems](http://www.admeris.com/) is a full-service provider of credit, debit, loyalty and gift card payment processing solutions, in partnership with the worldâ€™s largest financial institutions and technology partners.

The only problem is that thier PHP library is poorly written.

## Goals of refactoring

- Namespacing
- Bug fixes
- One class per file
- Modern OO code (PHP 5+)
- Remain relatively compatible with the [documentation](http://www.admeris.com/developers/downloads/).

## Updated examples

### Store a CreditCard

    $service = new Admeris(ADMERIS_MERCHANT_ID, ADMERIS_API_TOKEN, ADMERIS_URL);

    // No more crazy constructor
    $creditCard = new CreditCard();

    $creditCard->number = '5555555555554444';
    $creditCard->expiryDate = '1010';
    $creditCard->street = '123 Street';
    $creditCard->zip = 'A1B23C';

    $paymentProfile = new PaymentProfile();
    $paymentProfile->creditCard = $creditCard;

    $storageToken = 'my-token-001';
    $receipt = $service->addToStorage($storageToken, $paymentProfile);

    if ($receipt->approved)
    {
      echo 'Successfully Stored';
    }

### Create a subscription

    $service = new Admeris(ADMERIS_MERCHANT_ID, ADMERIS_API_TOKEN, ADMERIS_URL);

    // No more crazy constructor
    $creditCard = new CreditCard();

    $creditCard->number = '5555555555554444';
    $creditCard->expiryDate = '1010';
    $creditCard->street = '123 Street';
    $creditCard->zip = 'A1B23C';

    $paymentProfile = new PaymentProfile();
    $paymentProfile->creditCard = $creditCard;

    // No more crazy constants
    $schedule = new Schedule('week', 2);

    // No more crazy constructor
    $periodicPurchaseInfo = new PeriodicPurchaseInfo();
    $periodicPurchaseInfo->orderId = '10012';
    $periodicPurchaseInfo->perPaymentAmount = '1000';
    $periodicPurchaseInfo->startDate = '130101';
    $periodicPurchaseInfo->endDate = '140101';
    $periodicPurchaseInfo->schedule = $schedule;

    $receipt = $service->recurringPurchase($periodicPurchaseInfo, $creditCard, null);

    if ($receipt->approved)
    {
        echo 'Subscription approved';
    }
